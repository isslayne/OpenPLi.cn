   Stream2DB
   ========================================
   By: Aux (s_aukema@ not-so-coldmail . com

   Streaming plug-in that invokes your VLC server
   

		Version 0.4 <Release candidate>
		- Uses XML file for tv-stations
		- Some code optimalisation
		- Removed the stop button.. I didn't use it anyway
		Version 0.3 <BETA>
		- Reads IP number from movieplayer.xml config-file instead of hard-coded
 		- Sends the dreambox ip number to the VLC server, so the php script needs no configuration
		- Adjusted php script to accept ip-numbers
		- Adjusted php script to be platform independent (windows/linux)
		- Added button to stop the server to stream (to save bandwith)
	  Version 0.2
		- listbox with multiple streams
		- php script including code to handle variable in stream names
		Version 0.1
		- Proof of concept version
		- 1 button to start the streaming
		- simple php script

INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

	

Linux
Install VLC on your system
	- Check if this works correctly by running /usr/local/bin/vlc --version or /usr/bin/vlc --version
Install a webserver with php (apache/php for example)
	- Check if this works correctly.
	
Now put the startvlc.php file in the root directory of your webserver
	- Check if this works by pointing you webbrowser at http://localhost/startvlc.php

When everything passed the check, we can install the plug-in on the DreamBox.
Copy the WebStream2db.* files to /var/tuxbox/plugins/
Check the movieplayer.xml file in /var/tuxbox/config/webstream2db/ and see if the IP-number mentioned here is the same as 
the IP-number of your Linux PC

Now get your remote and start the streaming

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

It doesn't Work

1. Shut down all firewalls

2. Test the movieplayer using the webinterface of the dreambox.

4. Enter the following URL in your browser and check if VLC starts. You can see this with the taskmanager under Windows.
VLC should eat cpu power now. (don't mention the IP address here)
http://localhost/startvlc.php?url=http://cgi.omroep.nl/cgi-bin/streams?/tv/bnn/delamas/bb.laatste.asf&ip=192.168.1.2
--> If it doesn't work, VLC is not properly installed on you PC
