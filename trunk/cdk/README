To build an image

R is the directory where this README and make_cdk_image is found
Now run the make_cdk_image script passing the 
cdk root tree (e.g. $R), the destination directory (e.g. $R/dest) and
the box type (e.g dm7000 dm500 dm...). The destination directory
will be created if it does not exist.

	$R/make_cdk_image $R $R/dest dm7000
