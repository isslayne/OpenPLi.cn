HOWTO build a PLi image with OpenEmbedded

First of all, you need:
- A Linux station with enough resources, indicative: P4, 1 GB RAM
- At least 5 GB of free disk space in you working partition
- A connection with the internet

install the following packages:

g++
help2man
diffstat
texi2html
makeinfo (or texinfo)
gawk
git (or git-core on ubuntu)
subversion
cvs
rsh

Create a new directory and cd into there. Checkout the initial files:

svn co https://openpli.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openpli/trunk/pli-oe .

First time users should include an additional option "--username <name>" (without the quotes).

Create the necessary config files:

make initialize

now edit "build/conf/local.conf", change what you find after MACHINE into what
boxtype you're building for, either dm7020, dm600pvr or dm500plus

Make the initial image. This will download and initialise the git repository,
and build the image. You might be asked to accept some defaults, it is safe to press "enter".
After you issue this command the complete build will take a lot of hours:

make image

Once this is ready you will find the image in "tmp/deploy/images".

Once you have your initial image you can follow the next steps to build subsequent images.
Every time you want to build a new image these steps should be followed.

svn update
make openembedded-update
cd build
source env.source
bitbake dreambox-image
